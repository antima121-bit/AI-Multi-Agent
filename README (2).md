# Project Title
AI Multi-Agent CRUD System 
Project Overview
This project involves building an intelligent multi-agent system that can perform CRUD
operations on a mock database through natural language chat interfaces. The system will feature
two specialized AI agents that communicate with each other and learn from interactions to
provide contextual assistance.

##  Project Objective
Project Objectives
 Evaluate candidate's ability to integrate multiple technologies

 Assess understanding of AI agent architecture and communication

 Test database design and CRUD operation implementation

 Measure proficiency in full-stack development

 Evaluate natural language processing integration skills

## Tech Stack Use
Technical Requirements
Core Technologies Stack
Frontend:
 React.js with functional components and hooks

 Tailwind CSS for styling

 Real-time chat interface

 Agent status indicators

Backend:
 Node.js with Express.js OR Python with FastAPI/Flask

 RESTful API endpoints

 WebSocket support for real-time communication

 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server 
implementation

Database:
 PostgreSQL (preferred)

 Proper normalization and relationships

 Mock data generation scripts
AI/ML Integration:

 Google Gemini API for language model

 Context management system

 Agent-to-agent communication protocols
System Architecture

Agent Structure
Agent 1: Student Management Agent

 Handles all student-related CRUD operations

 Manages student profiles, enrollment, grades

 Communicates with Teacher Agent for related queries

Agent 2: Teacher Management Agent
 Handles all teacher-related CRUD operations

 Manages teacher profiles, subjects, 
assignments

 Communicates with Student Agent for related queries

## DataBase Requiremnt
Database Schema Requirements
Students Table:
- student_id (Primary Key)
- name (Required)
- roll_number (Unique, Required)
- email
- phone_number
- date_of_birth
- enrollment_date
- course_id (Foreign Key)
- teacher_id (Foreign Key - Advisor)
- created_at
- updated_at
Teachers Table:
- teacher_id (Primary Key)
- name (Required)
- employee_id (Unique, Required)
- email
- phone_number
- department
- subject_specialization
- hire_date
- created_at
- updated_at

Relationships:
 One teacher can advise multiple students
 One teacher can teach multiple courses
 Students are enrolled in courses taught by teachers
Agent Intelligence Requirements
Context Understanding
The agents must intelligently parse natural language inputs such as:
Examples:
 "Add student with name John Doe"
o Agent should ask: "What's John's roll number?"
o Follow up: "Which course should John be enrolled in?"
o Optional: "Who should be John's advisor?"
 "Show me all students under teacher Smith"
o Agent should identify Teacher Smith
o Display all students with Smith as advisor
o Offer related actions
Inter-Agent Communication
 Agents should communicate when queries span both domains
 Example: "Which teacher has the most students?" requires both agents
 Conversation logs should be visible to users
 Context sharing between agents
Learning System
 Agents should remember user preferences
 Learn common query patterns
 Suggest related actions based on context
 Maintain conversation history
UI/UX Requirements
Chat Interface
 Clean, modern design using Tailwind CSS
 Separate chat windows for each agent
 Agent status indicators (active, thinking, communicating)
 Message timestamps and sender identification

Dashboard Features
 Quick stats (total students, teachers, etc.)
 Recent activities feed
 Agent performance metrics
 Database connection status
Responsive Design
 Mobile-first approach
 Tablet and desktop optimizations
 Accessible design principles
